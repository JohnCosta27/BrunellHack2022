# BrunellHack2022 - Geochat

Getchat is a platform where users can create message that are tied to a physical location, and other users can view these messages when they are near these locations, this could work as:
- A review system (This pub is great!)
- A safety alert (This alley is dodgy)
- Meet up places (I am overhere!)

## Outcome

- 3rd Place.
- Winner of best use of DeSo.
